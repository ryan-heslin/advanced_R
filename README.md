# Advanced R Solutions

Hadley Wickham's (Advanced R)[https://adv-r.hadley.nz/] has influenced me like few other books. A few months after I began learning R, I stumbled across it while trying to understand how tidy evaluation worked. (If you have only a few months' experience in R, this is not a good idea).
I read the relevant chapters and started working through the exercises, learning much but making no effort to preserve my work. Since then, I've returned to it intermittently, sometimes as an aid when a problem stymied me, sometimes simply to learn about an aspect of the language I knew little about.
There are many free R textbooks available, but none has the same combination of clear exposition, useful examples, and interesting exercises. _Advanced R_, more than anything else, is the reason I consider R my favorite language, warts and all; it demonstrates exactly what makes R special.

Of course, you can't learn nearly as much merely reading as you can solving problems. In that spirit, this repository consists of Rmarkdown files containing my answers to _Advanced R_'s many exercises. The few times I checked the solutions manual to confirm an answer, I made a note of it.
